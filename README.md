# What is this?

This repository (freebsdrpi-cde) is intended to host the last release of the open
source CDE project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/)
that builds on Raspberry Pi 3B+ running FreeBSD.

# Why?

CDE really works nice on \*BSDs as they have more in common with UNIX than Linux has. Thus,
applications such as dtmail, dtcalendar works nicely. Because CDE is a tiny bit old desktop
environment it is much lighter than other desktop environments which makes it work nicely on
Raspberry Pis.

Upstream CDE has recently added many changes that does not build on RPI3B+. Unfortunately,
neither 2.3.0 release version does not work neither. Thus, this repo is a buckup of the most
recent building version (2.3.2a) to keep one of the building ones alive. As this repo is an
archive, I cannot really help with fixing bugs (Sorry!). If you want supported and newer version,
[cde-imake](https://github.com/lev105/cde-imake) might be worth checking out as well as [original 
repo](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cdesktopenv/).
